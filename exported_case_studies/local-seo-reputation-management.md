<h2>The Challenge: Great Pizza, Zero Visibility</h2>
            <p>
                Spice on a Slice made excellent pizza. Their regulars loved them. But online? They were invisible. With only <strong>14 Google reviews</strong>, they were buried beyond page two of local search results, effectively nonexistent to anyone discovering restaurants online.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every day, potential customers searched &quot;pizza near me&quot; and found their competitors instead. The shop&apos;s lack of digital social proof was strangling growth and leaving revenue on the table.

                <h3>Executive Axiom</h3>
                <p>
                    Satisfied customers don&apos;t become reviewers automatically. Without a system to convert in-store loyalty into online advocacy, even great businesses stay invisible to new customers.

            <h2>The Solution: We Built an Automated Review Generation Engine</h2>
            <p>
                We engineered a complete local SEO system, optimizing their Google Business Profile and deploying automated review generation that converts happy customers into online advocates.
            </p>

            <h3>Phase 1: Deployed In-Store Lead Capture + CRM Pipeline</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Configured a frictionless in-store capture system: free slice in exchange for contact info
                </li>
                <li>
                    Every contact instantly flowed into CRM for automated follow-up
                </li>
                <li>
                    Launched a <strong>database reactivation campaign</strong> via SMS and email to re-engage past customers and kickstart review generation
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 2: Activated Automated Review + Nurture Sequences</h3>
            <p>
                The system ran autonomously: every new customer received polite, well-timed <strong>review requests</strong> via SMS and email. Ongoing nurture campaigns drove repeat visits with promotions and menu updates, generating consistent reviews and compounding revenue.
            </p>

            <h2>The Results: 118 New Reviews. $25K Revenue. Page 1 Ranking.</h2>
