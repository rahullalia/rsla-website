## The Challenge: 50+ Clients, 4 Systems, Zero Visibility White Glove Cleaning had grown to 50+ recurring clients, and their operations were collapsing under the weight. Housecall Pro for scheduling. Google Sheets for customer notes. Manual texts for follow-ups. Email for invoicing. The owner was burning 20+ hours weekly on admin tasks. They'd hired 2 full-time employees just to answer phones and send confirmation texts. The operational bleeding: - **Customer data fragmented across 4 systems:** No single source of truth for history, preferences, or communications - **Manual follow-up workflows:** Employees typing the same confirmation texts, review requests, and rebooking messages hundreds of times monthly - **Weekly double-bookings:** Scheduling not synced with communication, conflicts guaranteed - **Revenue leaking everywhere:** No automated upsell, rebooking, or dormant client reactivation ### Executive Axiom Scattered operations don't just waste time. They create blind spots that cost you customers. Every disconnected system is a leak in your revenue pipeline. You can't fix what you can't see. [ Eliminate Your Blind Spots ](/#contact) ## The Solution: We Architected GoHighLevel as Central Command We rebuilt their entire operations infrastructure in GoHighLevel, creating a single source of truth for all customer interactions, scheduling, and communications. Critical constraint: they needed to keep Housecall Pro for scheduling. We engineered bidirectional sync so both systems stayed in lockstep. ### Phase 1: Engineered Housecall Pro Integration & Data Migration - Built custom API integration between Housecall Pro and GoHighLevel using Make.com - Migrated all customer data, job history, and notes into unified GoHighLevel contacts - Deployed bidirectional sync: jobs scheduled in Housecall Pro automatically create opportunities in GoHighLevel - Constructed custom fields tracking service type, frequency, property size, and preferences ### Phase 2: Deployed AI-Powered Communication Workflows - **Automated appointment confirmations:** SMS/email at 48 hours, 24 hours, and morning-of - **AI-personalized review requests:** Sent 2 hours post-completion with service-specific messaging - **Smart rebooking sequences:** Workflows triggered by service frequency (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly) - **24/7 AI chat widget:** Answers FAQs, books estimates, qualifies leads while the team sleeps - **Emergency request handling:** After-hours inquiries get instant responses with next-available slots ### Phase 3: Constructed Operational Command Dashboard - Custom pipeline views: New Leads, Active Jobs, Follow-Ups, Recurring Clients - Daily digest emails: jobs scheduled, completions, review scores, revenue at a glance - Automated reporting: customer lifetime value, rebooking rates, service profitability - Team task automation: quality checks and special requests routed automatically ### Client Testimonial "We went from needing 2 people just to answer phones and schedule jobs to having everything run automatically. I get a morning email showing exactly what's happening that day, and I can see our entire business in one place. The AI chat even books estimates while I'm sleeping. This paid for itself in the first month." - Owner, White Glove Cleaning ## The Results: 2 Positions Eliminated, $15K Revenue Recovered Within 60 days of go-live: - **100% operations consolidated:** All customer data, communications, and workflows in one system - **2 employees redeployed to fieldwork:** Admin positions eliminated, service capacity increased - **99% confirmation rate:** Automated reminders virtually eliminated no-shows - **37 leads captured, 18 converted:** AI chat widget booking estimates while the team sleeps - **14 → 132 Google reviews in 60 days:** Automated review requests running on autopilot - **$15K recovered annually:** Rebooking workflows reactivated 23 dormant clients ### Executive Axiom The right operations platform doesn't just save time.
