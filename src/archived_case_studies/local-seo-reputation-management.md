## The Challenge: Great Pizza, Zero Visibility Spice on a Slice made excellent pizza. Their regulars loved them. But online? They were invisible. With only **14 Google reviews**, they were buried beyond page two of local search results, effectively nonexistent to anyone discovering restaurants online. Every day, potential customers searched "pizza near me" and found their competitors instead. The shop's lack of digital social proof was strangling growth and leaving revenue on the table. ### Executive Axiom Satisfied customers don't become reviewers automatically. Without a system to convert in-store loyalty into online advocacy, even great businesses stay invisible to new customers.
